        <p>ANyone who's been on the internet for a while must remember Winamp. One may ask "That old music player with the really wonky skins? That old music player that really whipped the llama's ass? That Winamp?" Of which I answer; yes, that Winamp. Well, my point in saying all of this is that recently, they've made the choice to go open source, which is really cool, I absolutely love it! but the way it was handled was abysmal at best.</p>
